# Sleep-scout (in-progress)

Sleep-scout is an application aimed at showing the user the hotel offer. In addition, the site includes a travel blog. I created the application using React, Sass and Firebase.

# Live demo

App live version: https://sleepscout.netlify.app/

## What works

1. There is a contact form in the application that sends data to Firebase. Has email validation. Also, each input must contain text before sending.
2. Renders a list of hotels from Firebase. You can see the details by clicking on it.
3. Renders a list of articles from Firebase. Displays titles and photos. You can filter them using categories.

## What next
I am in the process of developing the application, many functionalities will be added soon, such as: displaying full articles, searching for articles by title, pagination of hotels and articles, "About" and "Gallery" sections. In the future, I would like to add the functionality of logging in and full hotel booking.
